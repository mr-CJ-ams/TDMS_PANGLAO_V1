## Introduction

In today's era of digital transformation and artificial intelligence, many local government offices still rely on manual systems that slow down service delivery.  

Panglao, Bohol‚Äîa leading tourist destination‚Äîmanages its tourist accommodation data using paper forms and spreadsheets, leading to delays, inefficiencies, human error, and difficulty complying with the monthly reporting required by Municipal Ordinance No. 04, Series of 2020 also known as ‚ÄúTourist Arrival Monitoring Ordinance of Panglao, Bohol.‚Äù  

The **Integrated Tourist Data Management System (ITDMS)** is a web-based platform that automates data collection, consolidation, and reporting. What once took over 10 days of manual work by tourism personnel can now be done in minutes, resulting in a **92.6% improvement in processing time**.  

The system features two main roles:  
1. **Establishments** submit guest data.  
2. The **Municipal Tourism Office** manages submissions and generates reports.  

To support future planning, the system includes an **AI-powered forecasting feature** that analyzes past tourist data and predicts accommodation demand. The most accurate model achieved a **94.79% forecast accuracy**.  

The ITDMS not only accelerates data handling but also enables smarter decisions, offering a model for other municipalities to modernize tourism data management in the Philippines.

## Forecasting Model

The Forecasting Model is a key component that predicts future accommodation demand based on historical data. The system utilized multiple machine learning models such as the XGBoost, Random Forest, Long short-term memory, and Facebook Prophet, combined with carefully engineered features to capture trends, seasonality, and external influences such as holidays.

</p>

Based on the results from different trained machine learning models namely XGBoost, Random Forest, Long Short-Term Memory, and Facebook Prophet, across three versions of features, XGBoost Version 3 demonstrated the highest accuracy of 94.92%. Compared to other models, XGBoost Version 3 was the most reliable in forecasting tourist accommodation demand as it consistently captured the upward and downward trends of actual tourist arrivals. 



## Prerequisites

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mr-CJ-ams/TDMS_PANGLAO_V1.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Database
1. **Install PostgreSQL:** Follow the installation guide for your OS.
2. **Create the Database:**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE rbac;
   \c rbac; -- Connect to the database
   ```
3. **Execute the Schema:** Copy the SQL schema from `server/database.sql` and execute it.
4. **Update Database Configuration:**
   Open the `.env` file in `server/routes` and update:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your-username:your-password@localhost:5432/rbac
   ```

### Step 3: Set Up the Server
```bash
cd server
npm install
node index.js
```
The server will start on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### Step 4: Set Up the Client
```bash
cd ../client
npm install
npm start
```
The client will start on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Running the System

1. **Start the Server:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   node index.js
   ```
2. **Start the Client:**

### Submissions
- Users submit guest check-in data via `/user/dashboard`.
- Admins manage submissions via `/admin/dashboard`.

---

## Deployment

To deploy to a live server:

### Server

- Set environment variables (DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, etc.) in the provider‚Äôs dashboard.

### Client
```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

### Database
- Use a managed PostgreSQL service (AWS RDS, Heroku Postgres, ElephantSQL).

---

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- Ensure `.env` contains the correct `DATABASE_URL`.
- Verify that PostgreSQL is running and accessible.

### Client-Server Communication Issues
- Ensure `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` in the client‚Äôs `.env` points to the correct server URL.

### Dependency Issues
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```
